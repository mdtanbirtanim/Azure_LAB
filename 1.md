## How to create & deploy/redeploy a static HTML web app in Azure by using CLI

**We considered following information**
        Resource Group_name = custome-rg
        Location = japaneast
        App_name = webserver-test
        Resourse Name = webapp 

**Sample static HTML web app**

        git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/html-docs-hello-world.git
        cd html-docs-hello-world

**Using this HTML file to deploy app by typing following command**

	    az webapp up --location japaneast --name webserver-test --resource-group custome-rg --html
	
**These stand for**
        //{	az > azure
            webapp > resource-name
            --location > The location where App will be deployed.
            --name > Application Name
            --resource-group > will create a resource-group
            -- html > html file look up 	}

 **If you would like to redeploy the updated code just run the same command as you performed at the beginning.**
    **This command will deploy contents to the existing application.**

	    az webapp up --location japaneast --name webserver-test --resource-group custome-rg --html

**Delete resource_grouup if you wouldn't need it by typing the following command**
	    az group delete --name rg_name
